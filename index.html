<h1 id="tiny-tent-house">Tiny Tent House</h1>
<p>This is similar to the idea of a yurt, but much
simpler to construct.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Very easy to build</li>
<li>Inexpensive</li>
<li>Comfortable temperature</li>
<li>Energy efficient</li>
<li>Electricity only for mobile devices</li>
<li>Sustainable</li>
<li>No fuel costs for heating/cooking</li>
<li>Uses little water</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basic-structure">Basic structure</h2>
<p>The shape of the structure is very similar to a Viking tent.
The tent is 16&#39; x 12&#39; and 10&#39;8&quot; in height.  The walls
are angled at 60 degrees.</p>
<p>The outer walls are (mostly white) canvas over 2&quot; denim insulation.</p>
<p>The 16&#39; base beams are reinforced by 12&#39; beams in the center and edges.</p>

<h2 id="heating-and-cooking">Heating and cooking</h2>
<p>The heating and cooking is provided by an indoor
Rocket Stove, ideally an EcoZoom Plancha or possibly
a Silverfire Hunter.  There is a chimney with a wind 
turbine ventilation attached coming out of the top
of the tent.</p>
<h2 id="temperature-and-ventilation">Temperature and ventilation</h2>
<p>There are three 2&quot; PVC cooling tubes angling to about 6&#39;
down forming a wide V shape totalling about 20&#39; 
in length.  These can be constructed by driving stakes
into the ground at an angle.</p>
<p>Air is drawn by convection towards the ventilation duct
at the top of the tent.  The ridge of the tent has an additional
2&#39; wide strip of black canvas to help facilitate a
temperature differential to promote air movement.</p>
<p>Thermal mass is provided by a 32 gallon trash can used for
extra water storage as well as at least 8 5 gallon water
bottles.  </p>
<h2 id="bathroom">Bathroom</h2>
<p>Ie the rear is a composting toilet and shower/bathing
area with a plastic container for a tub.</p>
<h2 id="electricity">Electricity</h2>
<p>Electricity is mobile (USB) only.  Solar is provided by
2-4 14W portable solar panels and stored in 1-20 20000 mAh
mobile lithium ion battery packs.  </p>
<p>In the winter the stove can boil water in a Power Pot
to recharge batteries.</p>
<p>Lighting is provided by USB LED bulbs.</p>
<h2 id="hot-water">Hot water</h2>
<p>Water is boiled on the stove or with solar thermal
boiler and placed in thermos and thermal carafe which
are placed in insulated thermal bag.  </p>
<p>Before going to the bathroom or washing hands, hot water
is poured into basin/bowl.</p>
<h2 id="fuel">Fuel</h2>
<p>There is a planter containing a small species of bamboo.
Gray water goes into this planter as much as the
capacity allows for.</p>
